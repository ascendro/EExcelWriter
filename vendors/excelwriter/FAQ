Q: Could you please add support for XYZGJGNDF?
A: Sorry, I don't have the time to make this a full-featured project. 
   It only contains the features which I need (and which were supported
   by SpreadSheet:WriteExcel anyway). You are welcome to add features
   yourself though and send it to me for inclusion.

Q: The files class.ole_pps_root.php and class.ole_pps_file.php are
   missing. Where can I get them?
A: They are only required for big file (>7 MB) support and available
   as a seperate project at
   http://bettina-attack.de/jonny/view.php/projects/php_ole/

Q: How can I create files bigger than 7 MB?
A: Use class.writeexcel_workbookbig.inc.php instead of
   class.writeexcel_workbook.inc.php. You'll need the php_ole project
   available at
   http://bettina-attack.de/jonny/view.php/projects/php_ole/

Q: Will you make the project PEAR compliant?
A: Probably. But this means a lot of work and will require some time.

Q: Is there a 'auto-column-width' function?
A: AFAIK Excel doesn't store this information in the XLS files but
   calculates the auto-width at run-time, so this doesn't seem to be
   possible, sorry.

Q: Is it possible to include Unicode strings in a worksheet?
A: Sorry, this is not possible due to the restrictions of the Excel 5
   format which is still used.

Q: Is it possible to include strings with a length of more than
   255 characters?
A: No, sorry. Please see the TODO file.
